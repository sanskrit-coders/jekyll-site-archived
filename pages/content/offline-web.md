## Zim

### Intro: Zim

Zim format( [http://www.openzim.org/wiki/Main_Page](http://www.openzim.org/wiki/Main_Page)) is very suitable for making many websites and online books available offline. All this is compressed into a single file of html pages. Thus formatting, java scripts, navigation links to next shlokas, sargas, images, searching, everything is preserved. And all platforms have zim client called kiwix. [kiwix-intro](http://www.kiwix.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Main_Page) .
  

### Uses

Note from shrI dAmodara:

=======  

To make our texts accessible to all present day people, only way is made it avialble in electronic format , which they have access, now a days more than books.But unfortunately Internet is not avialble cheaply. so it will be useful if we can provide the content ofline, And making option avilable to serve content to an entire institution premises, with out much server equipment and internet.
  
Here comes zim and kiwix handful to fullfill that job. presently kiwix can do  
  
1\. Kiwix can read zim files, which are nothing but all website compressed to one single file.  
And keeping javascripts, and formatting, images all safe.  
  
2\. And we can save any page back to html from zim file, and can dump back zim files to html files.  
  
3\. And very main feature is we can set up server with kiwix!!! which is very important feature  
  
>If we have zim file, and install kiwix-serve , then it acts like server, and any one can access content via wifi  
in premices, with out having internet at them or at server. So it will be too useful in schools, collages,Institutions, universities  
Rural areas, where internet is inaccessable. And we can even serve content without much equipment too,  
Just a raspberry pie even can act as kiwix-server  
  
So taking all these in account if we concentrate on building zim files, it will be helpfull to so many people, institutions. all books, wikis, every content.  
And kiwix has all platform clients. so mobile devices also can access off line content.And pcs can both read and serve to premices too.

## zim files of wikimedia project

  
these fallowing zim files related to wikimedia project are zimmed by automatic machine at kiwix . referances, side menus are cleaned. but seems when pages are not in text files, but in ocr forms, then they are not linked for next page like so, in some cases. for them we have to search again in bar for next page. It is problem with wikisource only. as they contain pages intended to be OCRed. I will soon provide well connected wikisource files very soon, by manual creation. but lot of main normal pages are rendering very well...
