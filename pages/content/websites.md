## Site hosting services
- <http://sites.google.com>
  - Disadvantage: Google holds your data, which is not easily exportable.
  
## Static site generators
- Jekyll
  - Can be used as a wiki - just look at the source for this site.
  
## Search engine optimization
- Google (Includes indexing for custom search)
  - Observe traffic patterns and crawl status at [Search console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools)
  - Submitting a sitemap submits multiple pages at once for indexing.
